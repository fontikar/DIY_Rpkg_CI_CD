In this part of the workshop, we will implement a few **GitHub Actions Continuous Integration workflows** for our R package we made in the previous session 📦! 

We will be using template workflows developed by the [amazing team of contributors](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/graphs/contributors) that run the [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) repo. Massive shout out to these folks for making our lives easier! 👏👏👏

### Helpful resources 🧑‍🏫
To get a general sense of what GitHub Actions Workflows are for R users, I recommend:

- Jim Hester's rstudio::conf 2020 [talk and slide deck](https://www.jimhester.com/talk/2020-rsc-github-actions/) t 
- Bea Milz 's [how-to blog](https://beamilz.com/posts/series-gha/2022-series-gha-1-what-is/en/#how-to-use-gha-in-an-r-package) 

If you want to know all the nitty-gritty details and eventually write your own custom GHA workflows, I recommend 🔍: 

- The [GHA official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).
- The [documentation](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples) in r-lib/actions repo
- The [Workflow Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) section of the GHA documentation. I've looked at this a few times to understand what exactly each step in r-lib/actions workflows were doing


**Let's get started! 🚀**

### The mise en place 👩🍳 

```{r Prep}
#install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools) #Will load usesthis and roxgen2 as well
```

### Git set go!!! 🏁

Before we jump in, we have to make sure  our [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) is set up correctly! Your PAT is our key to GitHub's API 🔑

Want to learn more about PAT? Highly recommend [this section](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html) of the Happy Git and GitHub for the useR!

First, we can check if we have git and PAT installed/set up correctly. You may have done so in previous projects! Your past self has your back! 🙏

```{r sanity check}
git_sitrep() # git situation report
```

If a PAT has already been set up, we would see this under the bold heading **GitHub**:

![](img/sitrep.png)

If you don't see this ⚠️ Follow the next steps to get a PAT. I recommend having a good read of `?usethis::gh_token_help()`

If you want more details, try the [tl;dr section](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#tldr) of the Happy Git and GitHub for the useR book and the subsequent chapters, these will get you on your feet in no time! 

```{r good help and create}
?usethis::gh_token_help()
```
#### Create a PAT token! 🎟

This function will open up a browser for you to select the scopes you want to your PAT to do. The recommended scopes are already pre-selected for ya!

```{r token}
usethis::create_github_token() 
```

If `usethis::create_github_token()` fails, try this link to create a PAT manually on the [GitHub Website](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,user,gist,workflow&description=R:GITHUB_PAT)

#### Saving PAT on your system 💾

Once you a PAT has been created for you, **copy and save this in your password manager!** For security reasons, you won't get to see the PAT again if you close the browser!  Now we will register your PAT using:

```{r gitset}
#install.packages("gitcreds")
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Once this is complete, just for peace of mind... check your git settings are OK!

```{r check twice}
git_sitrep() # git situation report
```

### Steady ahead to our first GitHub Action! 💥

**`{usethis}`** will be your portal to the most commonly use R GHA templates! You can access any of the templates from the `r-lib/actions` repository.

Remember `devtools::check()` from our previous sessions? Well, for our first workflow, we are going to set up a GHA to run `R-CMD-CHECK` on our R package in one operating system (by default its Ubuntu), on the latest version of R. 

Go ahead and run:

```{r}
use_github_action_check_release()
```
Notice, how this function does a few things on your behalf:

1. First it creates a hidden directory: `.github/`
2. Adds `.github/` directory to you `.gitignore`
3. Creates a directory: `.github/workflow`
4. Downloads version 2 of the R CMD CHECK  template from [ r-lib/actions/examples/check-release.yaml](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/.github/workflows/check-standard.yaml)
5. The function also prompts us to add the badge to `README.Rmd`! Who doesn't like badges!? Remember to knit to regenerate the `README.md`! 

Lets take a look at the `R-CMD-check.yml`:

- Explain the structure 
- Explain where each steps come from
- Where does the `v2` come from?

**Now commit these changes and push and see the magic work!**  🧙‍♀️

### Expanding to different OS and R versions 📚

What if we want to make sure your package can pass `R-CMD-CHECK` on Windows, macOS and Linux? Farewell virtual machines! You can do this all in one GHA workflow! 

Go ahead and run:

```{r}
use_github_action_check_standard()
```

Note that this will overwrite the pre-existing `R-CMD-check.yaml`. Allow this to happen, these workflow files can be regenerated by calling the respective `use_github_action_XX` function ♻️

Lets then take a look at the .yml: 👀

- Syntax of matrix


You can check out all the OS options [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) that are currently available on GHA servers

#### Other versions of R and dependencies

- `'release'` is the current release e.g. 4.2.1 
- `'oldrel-1'` is the release prior to current e.g 4.2.0 

You can request other R versions but change `'release'` to your desired version number like this:

```yaml
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        config:
          - {os: macOS-latest,   r: '3.5'}
```

You can use RStudio Package Manager to load specific versions of dependencies that were around at an earlier version of R. I have never done this before, but [this example](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/blob/09d5f5ee48b76384743d64fc2f9949cb79c79028/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) looks promising! I would be happy to investigate this with you 💪

### Spoilt for choice

There are many GHA workflows you can apply to a standard R package. 

Here is a handy  list of example templates from the  [r-lib/actions repository](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples). 

💡 TIP: If you are using RStudio IDE, you can use start writing `use_github_action_`  in your R console to see what type of GHA templates are already built in `{usethis}`

I tend to only use: 

- R-CMD-CHECK (`use_github_action_check_standard()`)
- test-coverage
- pkgdown (Covered in next session)

The choice is up to you! `lint` one looks promising if there are multiple contributors to the package and everyone's coding style is slightly different!

Lets set up `test-coverage` together. This workflow uses codecov.io to compute how the spread of your unit tests across your package functions.

```{r}
usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage")
```
